I am a Lecturer in Political Science at the [School of Politics, Philosophy and Languages (PPL)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-politics-philosophy-language-and-communication-studies){:target="_blank"} in the [University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}.  I teach various modules in Social Science Research Methods (mainly quantitative) and Comparative Politics. I am also a non-resident research fellow at the [Michael Nicholson Centre for Conflict and Cooperation](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/conflict-and-cooperation){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests focus on violent civil conflict and its peaceful resolution. I am interested in domestic political institutions, non-state armed groups, and international interventions to civil wars. I use statistical, computational, and experimental methods to study conflict and cooperation between political actors. 

I received my Ph.D. in Government from the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government/){:target="_blank"} in 2018 (dissertation supervisors: [Kristian Skrede Gleditsch](http://ksgleditsch.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Daina Chiba](https://dainachiba.github.io/){:target="_blank"}). I am also an alumni of [Erasmus Mundus Global Studies (EMGS)](https://globalstudies-masters.eu/){:target="_blank"}.
