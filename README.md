This is the repository for my academic website: https://baris-ari.github.io/

This website is based on *[Academic theme](https://github.com/gaalcaras/academic)* and some adjustments done by [Lukas Lehner](https://github.com/lukaslehner). Thanks to *[Burak Sonmez](https://github.com/brksnmz)* for suggesting this template.
